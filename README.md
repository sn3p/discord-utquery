# discord-reporter

UT99 Reporter Bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com).
This is very WIP and far from finished, so use at your own risk.

## Installation

Node.js v6.x or newer is required.

Install dependencies using `npm install`.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Or `npm run serve` to start the bot while monitoring for changes (handy while developing).

## Configuration

Create a config.json that looks like this:

```json
{
  "token": "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
}
```

## TODO

All the things ...

## Contributions

We are open for suggestions. Please feel free to open a new issue to post your ideas.
